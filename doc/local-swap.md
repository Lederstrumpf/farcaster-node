# Run a swap locally

This document describe how to test a swap running both participant locally.

You'll need to build and install the node locally as described [here](../README.md#locally).

We'll create two node instances and will make them running a swap, for that make sure to have access to the three services: an `electrum server`, a `monero daemon`, and a `monero rpc wallet`.

## Run `monero rpc wallet` with Docker

:warning: You should run two containers, one for each `farcasterd` services, choose different ports and modify `--rpc-bind-port` and `-p` values accordingly. Pull the latest image and launch two containers:

```
docker pull ghcr.io/farcaster-project/containers/monero-wallet-rpc:latest
docker run --rm -p 38083:38083 ghcr.io/farcaster-project/containers/monero-wallet-rpc:latest\
    /usr/bin/monero-wallet-rpc --stagenet\
    --disable-rpc-login --wallet-dir wallets\
    --daemon-host stagenet.melo.tools:38081\
    --rpc-bind-ip 0.0.0.0 --rpc-bind-port 38083\
    --confirm-external-bind
```

and

```
docker run --rm -p 38084:38084 ghcr.io/farcaster-project/containers/monero-wallet-rpc:latest\
    /usr/bin/monero-wallet-rpc --stagenet\
    --disable-rpc-login --wallet-dir wallets\
    --daemon-host stagenet.melo.tools:38081\
    --rpc-bind-ip 0.0.0.0 --rpc-bind-port 38084\
    --confirm-external-bind
```

See [run `monero rpc wallet`](./docker-stack.md#run-monero-rpc-wallet) with Docker for more details.

## Launch `farcasterd` services

We will start two daemons with different data directories (`.node01` and `.node02`). First configure both node (with config files `.node01/farcasterd.toml` and `.node02/farcasterd.toml`) to use the two different monero rpc wallets you previously started and change the port for `monero_rpc_wallet` accordingly:

```toml
[syncers.testnet]
electrum_server = "ssl://blockstream.info:993"
monero_daemon = "http://stagenet.melo.tools:38081"
monero_rpc_wallet = "http://localhost:{38083|38084}"
```

Then launch two `farcasterd` services:

```
farcasterd -vv --data-dir {.node01|.node02}
```

You can use other public daemons for syncers, see [:bulb: Use public infrastructure](../README.md#bulb-use-public-infrastructure) for more details.

## Configure `swap-cli` clients

For simplicity you can create two aliases for the `swap-cli`, you will use them to make and take offers:

```
alias swap1-cli="swap-cli -d .node01"
alias swap2-cli="swap-cli -d .node02"
```

## Access to assets

You need to have access to Bitcoin (testnet) and Monero (stagenet) test coins, use your wallet of choice. You just need a way to fund the swap in bitcoins and moneros.

## Make the offer

Maker creates offer and start listening. Command used to print a serialized representation of the offer that shall be shared with taker. Additionally it spins up the listener awaiting for connection related to this offer (bound on `0.0.0.0:9735` by default, with an offer public address of `127.0.0.1:9735` by default).

```
swap1-cli make --btc-addr tb1q4gj53tuew3e6u4a32kdtle2q72su8te39dpceq\
    --xmr-addr 54EYTy2HYFcAXwAbFQ3HmAis8JLNmxRdTC9DwQL7sGJd4CAUYimPxuQHYkMNg1EELNP85YqFwqraLd4ovz6UeeekFLoCKiu\
    --btc-amount "0.0000135 BTC"\
    --xmr-amount "0.001 XMR"
```

The command will create a public offer based on the chosen parameters, spin up a listening `peerd` (in that case `0.0.0.0:9735`), and return the encoded offer (starting with `Offer:...`).

This public offer should be shared by maker with taker. It also contains information on how to connect to maker (in that case `127.0.0.1:9735`). Additionally, it adds the public offers to the set of public offers in `farcasterd` that will be later used to initiate the swap upon takers requests.

To get a detailed explaination of make and more details on all possible arguments you can change run `swap1-cli make --help`.

## Take an offer

Taker accepts offer and connects to maker's daemon node with the following command (run `swap2-cli take --help` for more details):

Example of taking the offer above produced by maker:

```
swap2-cli take --btc-addr tb1qt3r3t6yultt8ne88ffgvgyym0sstj4apwsz05j\
    --xmr-addr 54EYTy2HYFcAXwAbFQ3HmAis8JLNmxRdTC9DwQL7sGJd4CAUYimPxuQHYkMNg1EELNP85YqFwqraLd4ovz6UeeekFLoCKiu\
    --offer Offer:...
```

The `--btc-addr` argument is the Bitcoin destination address in case the bitcoins need to be refunded or if the swap completes (depending on the swap role), the `--xmr-addr` for Monero, and finally the offer with `--offer` or `-o`.

Upon taking the public offer, its deserialized content is printed and the user is asked for validation with `y` or `n`.

:mag_right: Flag of interest: `--without-validation` or `-w`, for externally validated automated setups (skip validation in cli).

If you want to use your full nodes and infrastructure you can change the configuration to the following.

Farcaster needs to connect to three services to do actions on-chain and track on-chain events. Needed services are: an `electrum server`, a `monero daemon`, and a `monero rpc wallet`.

You can launch all the needed services locally by running the following commands:

```sh
bitcoind -server -testnet
electrs --network testnet
monerod --stagenet
monero-wallet-rpc --stagenet --rpc-bind-port 38083\
    --disable-rpc-login\
    --trusted-daemon\
    --password "pw"\
    --wallet-dir ~/.fc_monero_wallets
```

Then start the node with:

```
farcasterd -vv -c farcasterd.toml
```

with `farcasterd.toml` configuration file:

```toml
[syncers.testnet]
electrum_server = "tcp://localhost:60001"
monero_daemon = "http://localhost:38081"
monero_rpc_wallet = "http://localhost:{38083|38084}"
```
