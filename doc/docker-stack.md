# How to use `farcasterd` with Docker

This project provide some docker images and a docker compose setup to help running the node locally with less efforts. Before reading further make sure docker and docker compose are installed on your machine.

## Docker compose

To launch `farcasterd` on your machine clone this project and run:

```
docker pull ghcr.io/farcaster-project/farcaster-node/farcasterd:latest
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose logs -f --no-log-prefix farcasterd
```

:mega: Don't forget to pull images to ensure you are running the lastest version!

These commands launch a local Monero Wallet RPC and the Farcaster node, then follow the logs produced by `farcasterd`. Daemons used by the services are public testnet servers.

Install `swap-cli` on your machine (follow the documentation on [build and run locally](../README.md#locally)) and run:

```
swap-cli -x "lnpz://127.0.0.1:9981/?api=esb" info
```

For ease of use you can also create an alias:

```
alias swap='swap-cli -x "lnpz://127.0.0.1:9981/?api=esb"'
swap info
```

You should get a returned value from the node. You can use this stack to take a public offer or to make an offer. In the case you want to make an offer make sure the public address and the port will be reachable from external networks.

:mega: The only port forwarded to the host is `9735`, make sure to use this one when making offers (by default port `9735` is used).

To stop and remove the containers simply run in the project folder:

```
docker-compose down
```

### Images used

Images used in the docker compose are produced by the `farcaster-project` directly.

| Service      | Image                                                             |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `farcasterd` | `ghcr.io/farcaster-project/farcaster-node/farcasterd:latest`      |
| `walletrpc`  | `ghcr.io/farcaster-project/containers/monero-wallet-rpc:0.18.0.0` |

## Docker image

You can use the docker image directly with:

```
docker run --rm --init -t -p 9735:9735 -p 9981:9981\
    --mount type=bind,source=<config folder>,destination=/etc/farcaster\
    --name farcaster_node\
    ghcr.io/farcaster-project/farcaster-node/farcasterd:latest\
    -c /etc/farcaster/farcasterd.toml
```

If you don't use the default values for syncers daemons don't forget to mount your config inside the container (here at `/etc/farcaster`) and pass the config file with `-c /etc/farcaster/farcasterd.toml`.

or build the node image and start a container by running inside the project folder:

```
docker build --no-cache -t farcasterd:latest .
docker run --rm -t --init -p 9735:9735 -p 9981:9981\
    --mount type=bind,source=<config folder>,destination=/etc/farcaster\
    --name farcaster_node\
    farcasterd:latest\
    {farcasterd args...}
```

The container will be removed after execution (`--rm`), allocate a pseudo-TTY (`-t`), and publish exposed ports `9735` and `9981` on the host.

Stop the container with `ctrl+c` or `docker stop farcaster_node`.

:warning: this exposes the control bus on the host, only intended for debugging or on a trusted network.

## Run `monero rpc wallet`

:mega: No monero are stored long-term in this wallet, the wallet is only used to detect locking and sweep to the specified external Monero address given in parameter at the beginning of the swap! Data needed to create this Monero wallet are managed by farcaster.

You need to run a Monero wallet RPC server locally to manage receiving and transfering moneros during a swap. You can run your own wallet RPC or use the following commands to create a temporary wallet RPC with one of our Docker image:

```
docker pull ghcr.io/farcaster-project/containers/monero-wallet-rpc:latest
docker run --rm -p 38083:38083 ghcr.io/farcaster-project/containers/monero-wallet-rpc:latest\
    /usr/bin/monero-wallet-rpc --stagenet\
    --disable-rpc-login --wallet-dir wallets\
    --daemon-host stagenet.community.rino.io:38081\
    --rpc-bind-ip 0.0.0.0 --rpc-bind-port 38083\
    --confirm-external-bind
```

Then use the following values in `farcasterd` configuration file:

| `monero_rpc_wallet` | value                    |
| ------------------- | ------------------------ |
| mainnet             | `http://localhost:18083` |
| stagenet            | `http://localhost:38083` |

Remove `--stagenet` add change `--rpc-bind-port` and `-p` values to `18083` and connect to a **mainnet** daemon host, see [:bulb: Use public infrastructure](../README.md#bulb-use-public-infrastructure) for public mainnet daemon hosts.

## Connect a client

To connect a client and command `farcasterd` running inside a Docker container simply run:

```
swap-cli -x "lnpz://127.0.0.1:9981/?api=esb" info
```

This configure the cli to connects to the exposed port `9981` of the running container `farcasterd`.

### Remote client usage

Example from using other URLs supported by crate `internet2` `node_addr.rs`, besides the default inter process communication (also used by the Docker image to expose the control bus).

The daemon is controlled though ZMQ _ctl_ socket, an internal interface for control PRC protocol communications. Another ZMQ socket is used to forward all incoming protocol messages, the _msg_ socket. Both are node internal communication channels. Message from counterparty come through `peerd` services.

**Farcasterd**

To launch `farcasterd` with network binded _control_ (`-x`) bus and _message_ bus (`-m`) instead of `ctl.rpc` and `msg.rpc` files:

```
farcasterd -x "lnpz://127.0.0.1:9981/?api=esb" -m "lnpz://127.0.0.1:9982/?api=esb"
```

**Client**

The following client can instruct the above `farcasterd` to return general informations as follows (client uses the control bus to commuicate with `farcasterd`):

```
swap-cli -x "lnpz://127.0.0.1:9981/?api=esb" info
```

:mega: It is worth noting that _ctl_ and _msg_ sockets can use different type of communication. E.g. the docker stack only binds the _ctl_ socket over the network and keeps the _msg_ to its default `msg.rpc` file inside the data directory.
